This is a Linear Regression Model made in Python (only two external dependencies; Numpy and Pandas). This Model Predicts the house prices from the Famous Boston House Pricing Dataset. The Best thing about this model is that it is made from scratch, i.e, I have not used any High-level Libraries such as Tensorflow, Torch, Scikit-learn, etc. This makes the overall model performance much Customised and Easier.
